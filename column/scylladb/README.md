# scylladb

- We built our NoSQL database with a close-to-the-hardware, shared-nothing approach that optimizes raw performance, fully utilizes modern multi-core servers and minimizes the overhead to DevOps. ScyllaDB is API-compatible with both Cassandra and DynamoDB, yet is much faster, more consistent and with a lower TCO.
- ScyllaDB offers a multi-model database that supports flexibly modeling your data as a wide-column store or a simple key-value store. ScyllaDB enables organizations to scale your data across distributed database nodes for fast performance and high availability. By many estimates, ScyllaDB is the best wide column database on the market today.
